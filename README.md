# React Airbnb Clone

## Overview

This project is a learning repository where I built a simple Airbnb clone using React. The application showcases properties and integrates a map with markers to display the locations of the listed flats. Data is populated using a JSON file containing information about various flats.

## Project Features

* A map integrated into the application with markers for each flat.
* JSON file populated with flat listings for demonstration purposes.
* Basic layout mimicking an Airbnb-like experience.
